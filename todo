Need a perf. comparision between operator_drv -p and bc.
Right now, it is a factor of 10^4 in favor of bc.
The above is probably because of the translation from b63 to b10
For really b63 to be marginally faster, we will have to use all the the bits
of the 64 bit register. Right now, b63 does not use the MS bit to leave room 
for overflow during addition. 

A better implementation would all 64 bits and use assembly or a builtin to 
check the overflow flag.
